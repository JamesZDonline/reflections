When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be useful when trying to collaborate with multiple people, or even just work on
multiple computers. It is an easy way to keep everything up to date and accessible.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git were to pull automatically, then a branch you are working on may be modified without you wanting it to be. Having to pull gives you more control.
